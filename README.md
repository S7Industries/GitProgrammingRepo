# What is? 
This tool allow you to create remote repo in your local server, like git installed into a raspberry pi, creating and linking to your local repo.

# How it works?
You need to edit the file dataServer.py to insert the server data, you can add a array of servers or single server and adding a remote folder.\
In my local server I organized my repo by programming language, so I have a folder called python, c++, ecc.\
When you start the scrip you need to insert the repo name and language, based on the name of your folder, it will create you the repo in remote and local plus it will produce a file called clonedRepo.txt, in case you need to clone your repo.

# Future update
In future update my idea is adding support for github and a gui, using compex script via command line can be difficult and a gui made better everything.
